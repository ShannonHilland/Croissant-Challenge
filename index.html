      <h1>🥐 Croissants 🥐</h1>
      <p>
        Close your eyes and think back to a time when you bit into something and
        felt your eyes roll back as the only words going through your mind were:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-center">"Oh my goodness, that's good"</p>
      <br />
      <p class="mb-5">
        If I'm being honest, that's me whenever I get my hands on a warm, flaky,
        buttery croissant. They are absolutely my weakness. But if I may be so
        bold... I think these pastries are everyone's weakness. But what do
        these little crescents of guilty pleasure look like? Where can you get
        the best ones? That, my dear friend, is what this page is all about.
